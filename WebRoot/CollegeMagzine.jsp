					This cooperation also led to the arrests related to a planned
					attack on Iraqi Premier Ayad Allawi during his visit to Berlin in
					December. Police special units and state criminal police agents
					bugged phones and observed people. BfV agents had led them in the
					right direction. But according to Bavarian Interior Minister Günter
					Beckstein, investigators had no information from BND or its US
					counterpart, the CIA, about plans by the Ansar al-Islam
					organization to assassinate Allawi in Berlin. But Erich
					Schmidt-Eenboom, an intelligence expert, said he doubts Beckstein's
					statement. According to him BND officials have passed on
					information about Ansar al-Islam to BKA agents for years. "I
					believe that Beckstein deliberately doesn't reveal information," he
					said. "He should be informed better, what happens on the federal
					level as far as information exchange between intelligence agencies
					and police is concerned."
